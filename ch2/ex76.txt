* Generic operations with explicit dispatch
  * Adding a new type:
    * Implement each operation for the new type
    * Add a clause for the new type to each generic operation
  * Adding a new operation:
    * Implement the new operation for each type
    * Add a new generic operation with a clause for each type

* Data-directed style
  * Adding a new type:
    * Implement each operation for the new type
    * Insert these implementations into the table using put
  * Adding a new operation:
    * Implement the new operation for each type
    * Insert these implementations into the table using put

* Message-passing style
  * Adding a new type:
    * Implement each operation for the new type in the dispatch procedure
      within the constructor
  * Adding a new operation:
    * Implement the new operation for each type, as a clause in each type's
      constructor

It's easiest to add new types using message-passing style, and easiest to add
new operations using data-directed style.
