For the special case in Exercise 2.71, encode-symbol runs in O(1) time for the
most frequent symbol (whose encoding doesn't depend on n), and O(n) time for
the least frequent symbol.

Taking the memq calls into account, it still runs in O(1) time for the most
frequent symbol (as the procedure happens to check the left branch before the
more expensive right branch), and runs in O(n^2) time for the least frequent
symbol. In this case, each memq call will be searching a list containing one
less element as the tree is descended, for a total of n(n+1)/2 steps, which is
O(n^2).
